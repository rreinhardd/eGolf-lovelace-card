# Home Assistant Lovelace Picture-Element for Volkswagen eGolf
I used this card in my HA-Setup until 2021. Not 100% sure, if it works in the current version of Home Asisstant.

## Proposed Installation
* The images need to be placed in the image-directory e.g. "www".
* Create the sensor from sensor.yaml
* Copy and paste the Lovelace Code into the UI-Editor of HA
